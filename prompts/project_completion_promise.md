# Completion Promises (suggested)

Use exact matching strings (Ralph-style). Keep them unique and unambiguous.

- Task done: `<promise>DONE</promise>`
- Project production-ready: `<promise>PROJECT_PRODUCTION_READY</promise>`

Recommendation: rely on `--max-iterations` as the primary safety mechanism.
